                                        Charles is an alumni who majored in Mechanical Engineering. He decided to pursue this major because he grew up learning about computers and had a passion for building things. After building enough model kits, he figured he could probably build anything he can get his hands on. Not really knowing the differences between the different engineering disciplines, he decided to do mechanical engineering because it was the most broad field and could be applied to anything even computers. In the future, he wants to go into electromechanical manufacturing or product design. He has a passion for clean minimal designs that can be applied at a low cost and wants to design his own things in the future. Charles currently works for TEKintellect Inc. as the Head STEM Instructor and teaches a class of Scratch Programming. At school, he is involved with the fraternity and is making sure the upcoming class can be leaders and uphold the fraternities standards and values. During his free time, he likes to read, learn about things outside his major (programming, app development, etc.), plays sports, and practices martial arts.

He was also one of the Pledge Directors of Theta Tau. JC is part of other organizations in the NYU community as well, including I.F.A. at NYU, where he serves as a dance captain or choreographer each year. This also allowed him to teach workshops to raise money for charity. JC takes great pride in the relationships he’s made with others throughout his life, especially through these organizations and his high school step team. His now eight-years tenure of stepping has granted him the ability to unite those he leads with a certain feeling of family, enabling him to take on leadership roles in all of his collegiate organizations. If he was able to drop his career as an engineer, JC would dedicate his life to performance, while sharing his love for step, dance, fitness, sneakers, comic books, and video games with the community.

                                        Jennifer is currently a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering. She decided to pursue a career in the field of Electrical Engineering because she enjoyed her breadboarding and digital logics classes in high school. A number of her teachers including a math teacher, two electrical engineers and one mechanical engineer recommended that she become an engineer because they saw potential in her. Last year, Jennifer worked as a Teaching Assistant for the introductory General Engineering class and has previously worked for the Athletics Department at NYU Tandon and also at PineBridge Investments and Con Edison. She was recently the Rush Chair of Theta Tau. During her free time, Jennifer plays a number of sports including volleyball and she also enjoys watching action movies.

                                        Tiffany is currently a junior majoring in Electrical Engineering. She decided to follow the path of EE during the second year of high school after taking a Digital Electronics course with circuit design. She felt that it was something that was new and interesting to her compared to other topics taught in school. At NYU, she was the Professional chair in Fall 2015 and was the Scribe for Theta Tau. She was also a Student Orientation Leader and looks forward to doing it again because it is really enjoyable and satisfying. Outside of school, Tiffany works at Con Edison as an Engineering Aide. During her free time, she enjoys watching dramas from different countries and going out to the park to play handball.
