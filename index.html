                        <p>Theta Tau is the oldest, largest, and foremost Fraternity for Engineers. The purpose of Theta Tau is to develop and maintain a high standard of professional interest among its members, and to unite them in a strong bond of fraternal fellowship. The Theta Epsilon chapter at New York University was established on November 19, 2016 by thirteen founders. At NYU, we focus on achieving our goals within the three pillars of our fraternity: Brotherhood, Profession, and Service.</p>

                                        Hoyin is currently a senior studying Computer Science. Born and raised in New York, Hoyin grew her identity as a self-taught artist; always admiring the concept of how every line, stroke and mark contributes to the larger picture of a drawing. She sees a similar concept applied to programming where powerful and useful software applications are comprised of a system of text and knowledge. Hoyin also takes her canvas onto a virtual level and enjoys graphic designing with applications like photoshop. During her free time you can catch her casually zoning out to her Spotify playlist, etching a few drawings in random notebooks, eating ice cream, and petting dogs.

                                        Justin is currently a junior studying Computer Science at the Tandon School of Engineering. He loves solving problems and creating new content so he thought this would be a perfect major for him. Althought he majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the past, he felt that it just wasn't the right path for him. He is very adventurous, spontaneous, and likes to live in the moment. His many hobbies include basketball, movies, and photography.

He is currently on the eboard of KSA, or Korean Student Association. He also became a RA in Othmer hall this year. When he is free around in school, he is usually chilling on the second floor at the OSIRIS lab, the cyber-security research lab. You will most likely catch him either at OSIRIS goofing around or trying to code, or in his room playing some kind of video games. If you ever spot him listening to music, it probably will be either K-Ballad or classical music.
